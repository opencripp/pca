    <string name="instructions">Pre-work:\n
1) Requires Superuser is permanently installed. If you are using a stock blur rom go to the Play Store and download "/system/app/mover" and "BusyBox Free" (unless you are already BusyBoxed). Install BusyBox with app, then use /system/app/mover to move Superuser to /system/app folder.\n
2) Install Project Cheesecake App then move app to /system/app folder with a root access file manager (tip from Sam).\n
3) Nandroid Backup\n
\n
Cheesecaking:\n
1) Open app\n
2) Press gear icon, select server to check, app reboots to recovery\n
3) Format data, reboot\n
4) Create fake blur account (do not use your regular blur account - any nonsense will do)\n
5) Settings, About Phone, System Updates\n
6) Lather, rinse, repeat\n
\n
Sounds like a lot of work, but you actually spend most of your time waiting. Great to do while watching TV.\n
\n
Note: If you select a server that is offline you will not be able to create a blur account after reboot. You will either need restore your nandroid backup or skip blur.\n
\n
\n
P.S. You would think that after all this time someone would have figured out a way to delete blur accounts without having to factory reset.\n
\n
Tip from Sam: "Install it on the /system/app folder so it doesn't erase each time you do a factory reset"\n
